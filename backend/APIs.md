# Backend API - server.js

This document describes the HTTP endpoints exposed by the local Express server (`backend/server.js`). It includes method, path, example request/response shapes, and notes about required environment variables and auth.

Base URL (local):
- http://localhost:3001

Environment
- The server reads credentials from `backend/.env` (used by Supabase client and DB access):
  - `SUPABASE_URL` - your Supabase project URL
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - service role key for server-side operations
  - `DATABASE_URL` - (used by direct DB scripts)

Health
- GET /health
  - Response: 200
  - Body: {"status": "OK", "timestamp": "..."}

Workouts
- GET /api/workouts
  - Returns list of workouts.
  - Response: 200 JSON array of workout objects
    - Workout fields (camelCase): id, title, category, description, workoutType, sets, reps, duration, intensity, imageUrl, isGlobal, createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt

- POST /api/workouts
  - Create a new workout.
  - Request body (JSON):
    {
      "title": "string",
      "category": "string",
      "description": "string?",
      "sets": number?,
      "reps": number?,
      "duration": number?,
      "intensity": "string?",
      "imageUrl": "string?",
      "createdBy": "string?"
    }
  - Response: 201 created workout object (same shape as GET)

- GET /api/workouts/:id
  - Returns single workout by id.

- PUT /api/workouts/:id
  - Update workout fields (partial allowed).

- DELETE /api/workouts/:id
  - Delete workout (204 No Content)

Workout Plans (Routines)
- GET /api/workout-plans
  - Returns workout plans with nested plan items and (after consolidation) plan item scheduledDate
  - Each plan: id, name, startDate, endDate, userId, createdAt, updatedAt, planItems[]
  - Each planItem: id, workoutId, workoutPlanId, scheduledDate, intensity, createdAt, updatedAt, workout

- POST /api/workout-plans
  - Create a workout plan
  - Request body example:
    { "isRoutine": true, "userId": "<id>" }

- POST /api/workout-plans/:id/plan-items
  - Add a plan item to a plan. Accepts either explicit `dates` (array of YYYY-MM-DD) or a `frequency` token that the server expands into dated occurrences.
  - Request body examples:
    { "workoutId": "<id>", "dates": ["2025-11-03"] }
    { "workoutId": "<id>", "frequency": "Fri,Sun" }
  - Returns created plan item row (with nested plan_item_dates if present) or created dated plan_items after consolidation.

- DELETE /api/plan-items/:id
  - Delete a single plan item (or a dated occurrence depending on consolidation state)

Plan-item dated endpoints (if present)
- POST /api/plan-items/:id/dates  { date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' }
- DELETE /api/plan-items/:id/dates/:date

Users
- GET /api/users/:id
- PUT /api/users/:id

User default plan helper
- POST /api/users/:id/default-plan
  - Create (if missing) and return a default routine/workout plan for the given user.
  - Behavior: if the user already has any plans, returns the most recently created one; otherwise creates a new plan with:
    - name: empty string (DB NOT NULL handling)
    - startDate: today
    - endDate: today + 90 days
    - userId: the provided id
    - createdAt/updatedAt: now
  - Response: 201 created plan object or 200 existing plan


Notes & Implementation details
- Column naming: server expects camelCase column names in the DB (e.g. `createdAt`, `workoutType`, `imageUrl`). The server contains mapping code to accept legacy snake_case variants where needed.
- Scheduling model: the project supports two models:
  1) `plan_item_dates` table (separate occurrence rows)
  2) consolidated `plan_items` where each plan item has a `scheduledDate` (single occurrence per row)
  The server has code to work with the consolidated schema; migrations are available under `backend/supabase/migrations/`.
- Authentication: server-side uses Supabase service role key for server-to-DB operations. Do not expose this key in client code.
- Error handling: API returns 500 with a simple { error: '...' } for now and logs detailed DB errors to server console.

Local testing
- Start server (foreground):
  cd backend
  NODE_ENV=development node server.js

- Or start background and view logs:
  NODE_ENV=development nohup node server.js > /tmp/server_run.log 2>&1 &
  tail -f /tmp/server_run.log

Seeding data
- Utility scripts are in `backend/scripts/`:
  - `seedWorkoutsFromCsv.js` (Supabase REST-based seeding)
  - `seedWorkoutsDirectPg.js` (direct DB seeding via pg client)
  Use direct seeding if your REST service key is not accepted by PostgREST.
